Hello - I'm Adam.
=================
I'm a web developer based in West Hartford CT. For the moment, this site is only going to be used for my blog.

I have 10 years of experience as a musician and educator. As a web developer, I'm always trying new things and working projects for myself and clients. You can see some of my work at [my portfolio](http://adamjberkowitz.com).

Here are a few of the technologies I've learned lately or just use on a (nearly) daily basis.

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery
- Git/Github
- React/Redux
- Webpack
- Leaflet
- Gulp
- Node/Express (with Mocha/Chai for testing)
- Mongo/Mongoose

I’ve decided to start keeping a journal of what I learn as a developer. To start the process, I’m going to write about how I’m going about building a new portfolio. The one I have is fine(ish), but I feel like a successful portfolio should combine a few things.

- Good work done for clients
- Interesting projects I’ve made
- New skills I’ve learned and
- My own personality
# test

So, I’m going to keep this journal on a [Jekyll blog][jekyll] and cross post to [Medium][medium] as well.

My plan
---
This new portfolio should have a few characteristics. It should be (or have)

- A well thought out design that’s easy to navigate.
- Mobile first, fully responsive styling
- Fast load times
- A better logo
- My own contact form because I want to learn a little php.

Some aspects of the new site will stay the same. For instance I happen to like the colors and general layout I’ve got. Others will change such as the fonts, menu, and content.

My tools
---
This is going to get a little geeky, so you can skip this if you’re not into that sort of thing. Part of the goal here is to put into practice some of the skills and tools I’ve been learning. Another part is to experiment with technologies or techniques I’m not entirely comfortable with so I can refine them. After all, if I can’t use them on my own site, I shouldn’t expect to use them on anyone else’s.

So, what will I use?

- Sass for styling with Bourbon and Neat (maybe a little Refills) for mixins and structure. (For better or worse I’m dropping Bootstrap.)
- Gulp to run tasks
- Webpack so I can practice writing ES6 syntax, inject critical CSS, and try code splitting.

Some inspiration
---
As I’ve been thinking about this project, I’ve been looking at other portfolios to see what I like and what I don’t. I’m not going to get into what I don’t like. We’re going to stay positive. Here are just a few (of the many) sites I looked at and what I liked about them.

[BrightByte Studio][brightbyte]

- It’s structured really beautifully. I like that there’s a good amount of white space but it doesn’t feel empty.
- The fonts are put together nicely.
- My favorite thing is the “Menu” button in the mobile view. I like how they rotated it so they didn’t need a fixed header but could also keep the button visible.

[Meredith Underell][meredithunderell]

- I like her logo/initials.
- The colors are nice together.

[Tobias Ahlin][tobiasahlin]

- There are so many little details and character!
- The main page seems really well thought out to me and the blog is made in Jekyll (good motivation there).

[John Kavanagh][johnkavanaugh]

- It’s really clear what he does and how to get in touch with him.
- The colors are nice and each page has it’s own scheme.
- The “my availablity” page is a great alternative to a calendar.

Conclusion
---
I think this journal and site update will be an excellent way for me to keep track of my progress, demonstrate what I’ve learned, and get some feedback and advice from other developers.

NB: It's worth pointing out that for the moment I'm using the default Jekyll theme. That's for expediency more than anything else. I'm going to be updating this a little at a time but the primary focus will be the portfolio.
